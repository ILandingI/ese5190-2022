# ESE 5190 Final Project: Smart Access Control: A Secure and Convenient Door Entry System using Photoresistor and IC Card Reader Technology


##  Project Description
This access control system is designed to provide secure and convenient access to a specific area. It uses a combination of photoresistor and IC card reader technology to determine who can enter and who cannot.

The photoresistor is a device that can detect the ambient light and adjust the brightness of the lighting accordingly. This ensures that the area is well lit, making it easy for users to see and navigate, while also increasing security.

The IC card reader, on the other hand, is used to read the access control cards, which are assigned to different users or groups of users. Each card is programmed with a specific level of access, which will activate different lights according to the level of access. For example, a card with a higher level of access might activate a green light, while a card with a lower level of access might activate a red light. This allows for easy identification of different levels of access. The system is built with Python.

Overall, this access control system is designed to provide secure and convenient access while being easy to use and manage. It uses a combination of advanced technology and easy-to-use software to provide a secure and user-friendly experience.

LED:
Displays the door's open/closed status
Red means closed, green means open

RGB LED:
Displays the level of the employee card when swiped
White light flashes three times when card is incorrect

OLED Display:
Displays employee card information

Infrared Sensor:
Controls the timing of the door
Works with the light sensor to activate photo LED and control door

IC Reader:
Reads employee card and sends information to the board

Light Sensor:
Detects light intensity

White LED:
Lights up when light sensor detects low light and infrared sensor detects someone at the door
Provides illumination
